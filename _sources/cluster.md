# Running a CFD simulation on an HPC cluster

Here, we present an automated pipeline for performing CFD simulations
followed by post-processing of the results on an HPC cluster. For this
tutorial, we have used the supercomputer
[Saga](https://documentation.sigma2.no/hpc_machines/saga.html) as our
starting point.

The automated procedure for running simulations on a cluster is part of
the preprocessing script `automatedPreProcessing.py`. The
script includes the `--simulation-config` flag (`-sc` for short), which
should be followed by the path to a configuration file for the remote
simulation. As a template, we have included the configuration file
`ssh_config.json`, which the user will need to edit. The template
contains the following fields, and is set up for the `Artery.py`
problem:

``` json
{
  "hostname": "YOUR_HOSTNAME",
  "username": "YOUR_USERNAME",
  "password": "YOUR_PASSWORD",

  "remoteDataDir": "Oasis",
  "localDataDir": "test/Case_test_artery",
  "simDataDir": "simulation",
  "postProcDataDir": "automatedPostProcessing",

  "job_script": "artery_job.sh",
  "problem_file": "Artery.py",
  "flow_rate": "ICA_values"
}
```

Here, we assume that the *Oasis* framework has been cloned
or copied to the home directory on the cluster. The capitalized values
are to be edited by the user, and possibly the `remoteDataDir` depending
on the location of the remote *Oasis* folder. The
`localDataDir` points to the path where the mesh, mesh information, and
probe points are stored, and we assume that the file defined by the
`job_script` key is located there as well. The job script currently
located within the `test/Case_test_artery` folder is specific for the
`Artery.py` problem run on Saga, but is adaptable to other simulations
and clusters. The user will also need to edit `artery_job.sh` with their
username information, cluster project, and FEniCS module location, all
highlighted in the example job script. Then, to perform pre-processing,
CFD simulation, and post-processing through a single script, run the
following command:

``` console
$ python automatedPreProcessing/automatedPreProcessing.py -m diameter -i test/Case_test_artery/artery.vtp -c 1.3 -sc automatedPreProcessing/ssh_config.json -vz False
```

If the script is successful, it should output:

``` console
Submitted batch job XXXXXXX
```

where `XXXXXXX` is the job ID.
